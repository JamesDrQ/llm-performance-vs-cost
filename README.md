# LLM Performance vs Token Pricing

This repository contains my contributions to a group final project
for COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) at UC San Diego.

## My Contributions
- Led EDA and visualization of token pricing distributions
- Implemented regression models (SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Analyzed weak predictive relationship between benchmark scores and cost

## Project Summary
We study whether benchmark performance can explain LLM token pricing
using public leaderboard data.

This is your group repo for your final project for COGS108.

This repository is private, and is only visible to the course instructors and your group mates; it is not visible to anyone else.

Template notebooks for each component are provided. The numbers on the notebook filenames provides the order things are due.  See the syllabus for the due dates in your quarter.

You will be graded based solely on the numbered Jupyter notebooks in this repository.  You will recieve your grade and feedback on how to improve via GitHub Issues on this repository. 

We have created a suggested organization for your repo, including directory structures for storing `./data`, `./results`, and for creating `./modules` that your notebooks can import. 

Its worth noting that `./data` is for storing local copies of the data, but by default this repo is configured to **not** allow you to store common datafiles in GitHub.  This is because GitHub has low limits on maximum file and repo size.  So instead you would download your data direct from its original provider or from your personal cloud storage. There are scripts inside some of the notebooks to download data from any URL to `./data`.  If you wish to remove this limitation and store small data files directly in your GitHub you should edit your `.gitignore` file.

But this is *your* repo. You are free to manage the repo as you see fit, edit this README, add data files anywhere you want, etc. So long as there are the four numbered Jupyter notebooks in place on the due dates with the required information, the rest is up to you. 

At the final project date there is an option to make your final project visible to others.  If you choose this option your repo will become publicly visible. 

Also, you are encouraged to share this project after the course and to add it to your portfolio. If your repo is public you may fork it. If it is private you may follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PP-vlsyWjNegGGsmeDB5B-ltjYW1Db14q9dx3HM9e4/edit?usp=sharing)
